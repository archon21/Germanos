          Johnny had the opportunity to learn about New york style pizza and
          italian food from living New Haven for a few years, with some help
          from a chef from Italy. Johny then learned about running a restaurant
          from working as a Head Chef in Old Saybrook, during that time, he got
          acquainted with a man from Colchester who wanted him to run his
          restaurant and he fell in love with the beautiful scenery, people and
          nature of the town, and decided to move there himself.
